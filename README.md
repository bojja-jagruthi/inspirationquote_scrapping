Title: "InspirationalQuote Scraper"

Description:
Developed a Python script that scrapes a "Inspirational quote" from a designated website and displays it to the user in the terminal.
This project focuses purely on the art of web scraping without the bells and whistles.

Features:
Web Scraper: Utilize Python libraries like Beautiful Soup to scrape the daily quote from a website such as goodreads.com.

Display Quote: Once the quote is scraped, simply print it to the console/terminal for the user to read.

Error Handling: Implement basic error handling. For instance, if the website is down or the structure changes such that the scraper can't find the quote, provide a friendly error message to the user.

Logging: (Optional) Log each daily quote to a text file, ensuring that you have a record of past quotes.
